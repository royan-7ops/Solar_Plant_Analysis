 Solar Plant Analysis

 Project: Energy Recommendation System using solar plant data

 Description:
 This project focuses on analyzing solar plant data to understand energy generation patterns. The   dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed to prepare for further analysis and future predictions.

 Contents: 
- `Plant_1_Generation_Data.csv` → Raw dataset  
- `Week1_Data_Loading.ipynb` → Notebook showing data loading and preprocessing steps

 Objective:
 Prepare the dataset for analysis and prediction of energy generation, serving as the foundation    for the Energy Recommendation System.
