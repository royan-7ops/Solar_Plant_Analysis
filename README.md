🌞 Solar Energy Prediction (Edunet Internship Project)

📘 Overview
This project predicts solar power generation using real data from Indian Solar Power Plants.
It was developed as part of the Edunet Foundation Internship under the domain Energy Prediction.

🗓️ Weekly Progress

Week 1 – Data Loading & Understanding

Uploaded and extracted dataset files

Loaded CSV into Google Colab

Explored dataset shape, columns, and sample data

Week 2 – Model Training & Prediction

Preprocessed data (converted DATE_TIME, extracted hour)

Split data into train/test sets

Trained Linear Regression and Random Forest models

Evaluated performance using R² Score and MAE

Random Forest achieved R² = 1.0 and MAE = 0.145 🎯

⚙️ Tools & Libraries
Google Colab
Python 3
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

📊 Results

Model	R² Score	MAE	Remarks
Linear Regression	1.00	0.715	Baseline model
Random Forest	1.00	0.145	Excellent performance
